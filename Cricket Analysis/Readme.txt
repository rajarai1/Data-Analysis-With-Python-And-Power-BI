Problem Statement
To Develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into cricket match performances by leveraging data scraped from 
ESPN Cricket website using Python and the Pandas library. The dashboard should visualize team-wise matches winners frequency, 
batting performance metrics, bowling statistics, and strike rates to enable users to analyze trends, identify top performers, 
and understand team strengths. The goal is to create an intuitive and informative interface for stakeholders to make 
data-driven decisions based on historical cricket match data.
